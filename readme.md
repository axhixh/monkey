# Interpreter and Compiler for Monkey

This project is a Standard ML implementation of interpreter and
compiler for Monkey, the language of Thorsten Ball's book on
interpreter and compiler.

The books are available at [Writing An Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)
and [Writing A Compiler in Go](https://compilerbook.com/). These
books implement using Go. This repository uses [Standard ML](https://smlfamily.github.io/)
for its implementation.

This project is my attempt at learning Standard ML while learning
about interpreters and compilers. The focus is on writing idiomatic
Standard ML code than staying true to the implementation in the book.
